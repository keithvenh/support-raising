Bro! Totally cool if you're not interested, but I have what I think is an amazing real-world app idea that I think could actually make some serious money:

Call it what you will, but for simplicity I'm calling it SRT: Support Raisers Toolbelt. Here is the concept:
One app that combines all the things support raisers need to be successful:
1. A Place where you can track your contacts - essentially a CRM
Track what is their name, spouse, kids, phone numbers, emails, address, job, birthdays, when you last were in contact with them, how you were last in contact with them, whether they've committed to any support, whether they actually followed through on giving that support, etc.
2. A To-do list linked to your CRM - 
Been out of touch with someone for too long? The app automatically adds a Make Contact with So-and-So to your to-do list. You can customize what frequency you want reminded of, and also add whatever to-dos you want to the list as well. In addition to just having to-dos, you can set up a team or household and assign to-dos to specific people. i.e. I assign "contact friend from high school" to Hilary, etc.
3. An income tracker
Track both monthly donations to make sure a supporter hasn't accidentally dropped off your support, as well as one-time gifts
You can know when a one-time gift was given, and break it across multiple months to help with monthly budget or use it for a specific project
4. A Budget App
Seamlessly integrated is an envelope system budget app that allows people to track their actual expenses right in the same app they are tracking their income - budget app also allows for tracking project based goals, like raising extra funds for a furlough or a trip to Mozambique
 
5. A Fundraising Goal
Where your budget helps you manage the actual money you're getting in, your fundraising goal allows you to set a "Dream budget" or "Goal Budget" and track how your fundraising is progressing in terms of that budget - i.e. I can allocate my monthly funds first to rent, then to food, and so on until I know that I'm 100% funded!
6. A major bonus options would be email and text
Being able to send emails straight from the app would be a fantastic addition, though not completely necessary. It would just make the integration that much smoother.
Would love to know your thoughts. Not saying we have to program it together, but do you even think it is a good idea?
YWAM alone has over 30,000 missionaries, and if you think of CRU, Navigators, Frontier, Converge, Pioneers, IMB, OMM, AIM and more it could be a huge need.
To date, I haven't found something that is user friendly and works on phones
And I haven't found anything that puts all these tools in one place...
If you only got 1,000 missionaries to pay for a yearly subscription to the app and charged $100 a  year, it would still be $100,000 Gross income...

I obviously have never looked into something like this, not having a need for it really. If you haven’t found something, then I think it could work. 

If you’re serious about creating an app that will be used by that many people, you’d need to do research to find out what current missionaries and other people that raise support are currently doing for each of these areas, whether people you talk to would have interest in using an app like this (is it a real pain point for them?) and if they would be willing to pay for something like this. Basically market research. 

The thing that makes these things successful is paying for advertisements to get it to the top of the App Store, word of mouth, and usage. The more people who use (and like) the app it will move further to the top of the app list.
It sounds interesting to me! I’m not sure I’m qualified to help program an app of that scale, but I’m willing to try!

yeah. i know there is a lot that goes into it, but i know that good support anraisers use these tools, and have to do them all separately (like were doing) and adding the budget app is something everyone needs... im paying $60/year for just the budget app i use... dave ramsey charges 120/ year for his budget app suite.
id almost say the best thing would be to develop a minimally viable product then get someone like dave ramsey or steve shadrach to get on board with it, and hand it over to a professional app development company for full development and management...
Id also assume that non christian workers could use it for fundraising (think any non-profit) in some capacity
idk. I've been debating developing it for us to use on our own, but if I'm going to all that work, then I could probably make it usable by more than just us...
just a thought.
The missions world is completely different from the rest of the world in that there are tools we need and use that will never make it to the top of the app market, but that could be used by the entire missions community because their Support trainers (Support Raising Solutions and Steve Shadrach) or their company Frontier, Pioneers, YWAM, etc. recommend the app.
The number one thing I hear other missionaries say: "I need to raise more support", "I need financial breakthrough", "I need to figure out my finances" - so I know the need is there...
